# Raspberry Pi Project 'Time Lapse Camera'


## Incentive

The goal of this project is to make it possible to create time lapse videos with a raspberry pi. I mainly want to use that for creating time lapses to observe what my 3d printer did, when it messed up as well as when the print succeeded.


## Goal

- [ ] Write program on the Pi that can regularly record photos with a given period
- [ ] Provide an easy way for general settings and commands
    - [ ] Start/stop recording
    - [ ] Change frequency
    - [ ] Turn off automatically (after some time)
- [ ] Make the resulting video available
    - [ ] Via SSH
    - [ ] Send via telegram
    - If using with GUI, display it there


I now decided to write a website, hosted on the pi, which solves the problems.
